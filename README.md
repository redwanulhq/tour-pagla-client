## TOUR PAGLA 
This web app is one of my assignment on a Tourism Agency. This is my first ever full-stack websit. On this website I have used `React`, `firebase`, `react router`, `node`, `express`, `mongodb` etc.

Here is the live site link: https://react-tour-pagla.web.app

On this Website :
* You can access only homepage without login yourself
* If you login you will get 3 extra routes. The are `My Booking`, `Manage All Booking`, `Add Tour Packages`
* You will also get access to Book any tour package by Authenticate yourself
* You can only login with google accout
* After booked your trip, admin need to approve your booking for update booking status
* You can cancel your booking whenever you want
* Admin can add tour package and delete newly added tour package from `Add Tour Package` route
* You can see only your booking package from `My Booking` route
